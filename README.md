# Razer Boomslang review

Here is the [Live site](https://razer-boomslang-review.netlify.app/)

## I used tailwind css to do all of the styling in this react project.
* First I added the navbar with the links as simple placeholder paragraphs.
* Then I made the header section with the headline and the image.
* Then I used a custom hook to get review data from a local json file.
* Then I sliced that array to separate the first three reviews and used the review component to show them in the homepage.
* In the review page I loaded the same data using the custom hook and showed all 6 reviews.
* Then I added a bar chart and a line chart using rechart. I fetched the data from the provided github repo.
* Then I made the blogs section where I used a blog component to answer the questions.
* Then I made the site responsive for mobile and tablets.
